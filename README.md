## Data Deposition / Fandango CLI

### Intro

Welcome to the FandanGO ARIA plugin. 

**This is a WIP: some functionality is not currently available**



### Quickstart

- [ ] Clone Repository 
- [ ] Set up `config.yml` (copy structure from example)
- [ ] run `pip install .` in root repository
- [ ] run `fandango`
- [ ] run `fandango login`. This will require an ARIA account and a populated `config.yml`
  - currently the login command is hard coded to use a password in the config.yml. Change this in `fandango/commands/login.py` if needed
